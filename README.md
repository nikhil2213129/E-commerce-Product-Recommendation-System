## Introduction
In the competitive world of e-commerce, personalized product recommendations can significantly impact user engagement and sales. This project builds a recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to suggest relevant products to users.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information such as:
- `UserID`: Unique identifier for users
- `ProductID`: Unique identifier for products
- `Ratings`: User-provided ratings or purchase frequency
- `ProductFeatures`: Information about products like category, price, etc.

The dataset may come from an e-commerce platform's historical data or a public dataset such as the [Amazon product reviews dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15f_G6TUJ7iF0jk8NMkOHHzNwLAoOGmRm/view?usp=drive_link)).

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `surprise` (for collaborative filtering)
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Modeling Approach
The notebook covers the following steps to build a recommendation system:

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize key statistics about users, products, and interactions.
Recommendation Algorithms:
Collaborative Filtering: This method recommends products based on the similarity between users or items.
Content-Based Filtering: This method recommends products based on the features of items that a user has interacted with.
Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation quality.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as precision, recall, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
